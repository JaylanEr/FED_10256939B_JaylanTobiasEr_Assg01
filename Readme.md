# Your Project's Name

My project is a website for a university called Camperd University. It is supposed to showcase some parts of the university to appeal to potential university students for them to enrol into. The website shows a brief introduction to its courses, locations, facilities as well as some reviews from past students. The website aims to let students know more about Camperd University before they apply to a university so as to expand their choices on which one to choose.

## Design Process
The website aims to attract university students, their parents and may also attract teachers.

- As a university student, I would want to observe the different types of universities. I would not only choose my course of studies but would also like to look at the facilities and locations of various universities to see which of them would appeal to me the most.

- As a parent, I would like to look at the location of universities so that I will know how far is it for my child to travel or how far they would be from me and I would also like to look at past student's reveiws to see if this university has a good reputation.

- As a teacher, I would like to view the facilities as I would be in the school often and will need to make use of the facilities, so I would need to know what they have and the quality of it. I would also like to view other student's reviews to see how things are like at the school and what they enjoy or dislike about it.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features

- There is a navigation bar that allows the users to switch to different pages depending on what they want to view.
- In the homepage, they can also scroll downwards to view all the content without having to switch pages so that it is more convenient.
- The website changes in mobile view and there is a menu at the top that can be expanded which will display the navigation bar.

### Features Left to Implement
Potential Improvements
- A working enrolment feature could be implemented in the future so that you can fill out an application form and submit the form.
- A page that lists out all the different courses for various level of studies.
- A page with actual address of the various branches around the world with a map that showcases it as well as a map of the entire university.
- A page to contact and visit official pages for (fictional) social media of the university.

## Technologies Used

## Testing
My website is smaller in mobile view and more compact, with the navigation bar being compressed into a menu compared to when it is in desktop view where the navigation bar is open and spaced out without a menu.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
When I tried to add icons such as the Facebook logo, Instagram logo or LinkedIn logo, it did not appear as the logo but instead as a box with an X in it, so I decided not to place them inside the website.
